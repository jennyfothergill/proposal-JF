Looking for alignment between motivation, gaps, work to be performed.

Starting with Motivation-
Missing figure to make case for dire situation? 
Maybe move fig 1 to bottom of page so numbers paragraph stands on its own.


Inferred outline:
    Climate crisis bad
    Theoretical efficiency (paragraph 2, needs flipping)
        We're focused on OPVs because there's room for improvement
    Find blend of compounds and processing resulting in best structure
    Imagine chemist (do they synthesize morphologies?)
    Molecular simulation will help (getting into details too much maybe?)
    Open-source packages exist. This paragraph has strong ideas in it.
    For this research we propose... CG models to obtain OPV polymer morphologies (we want blends, too?) (Missing a summary statement here that wraps all the bits into one?)

    Research objectives 
        (Mention of no best scheme for CG should go up in motivation?)
        (Put 1-sentence summaries of objectives up here)

    Background:
        OPVS

        (figure 5 clipping MD heading?)

Length perfect right now.
