today I got this repo set up. Next time, I'll reskim these papers:

MARTINI\cite{Marrink2007}

VOTCA\cite{Ruhle2009}

TraPPE\cite{Maerzke2011}

and read this: \cite{Chakraborty2018a} 

got busy with fancy-ing up the GIXStapose repo, helping rachel, office hours, and atom-typing with gaff-foyer with ryan and chris. Briefly skimmed the chakraborty paper-- they consider all possible mappings that a cg compound can have in order to systematically pick a cging scheme.
