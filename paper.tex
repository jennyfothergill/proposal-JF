today I got this repo set up. Next time, I'll reskim these papers:

MARTINI\cite{Marrink2007}

VOTCA\cite{Ruhle2009}

TraPPE\cite{Maerzke2011}

and read this: \cite{Chakraborty2018a} 

got busy with fancy-ing up the GIXStapose repo, helping rachel, office hours, and atom-typing with gaff-foyer with ryan and chris. Briefly skimmed the chakraborty paper-- they consider all possible mappings that a cg compound can have in order to systematically pick a cging scheme.
OK Chakraborty notes:
-exclude cg mapping schemes to those that maintain symmetry
-Zhang and Voth designed CG mapping operators by preserving "essential dynamics"
-Cao and Voth worked on centering functions COM vs center of charge. They found center of change was better for preserving intermolecular structure.
-Wagner generalize centering functions to arbitrary thermodynamic quantities
-Marrink grouped four heavy atoms and showed that this simple consistent scheme works.
CG models are validated by preservation of rdfs and velocity autocorrelation functions (vacfs)

Today I'm reading the VOTCA\cite{Ruhle2009} paper with the goal of answering these questions:
how do they choose a chromophore?

how do they calculate the transfer integral?

how do they do backmapping?

other notes:
CG methods--IBI, force matching, inverse MC. This paper goes over details of these and how they're implemented in votca. This wasn't really what I wanted to read about so I skimmed.
They use ESPResSo++ for quantum calculations
OK, this isn't the right paper to read about CT stuff or backmapping. Let's look at some of these [http://www.votca.org/citations/using-votca](http://www.votca.org/citations/using-votca)
Also I'm noticing in this list of papers--Marrink (cited by chakraborty) is here and there is a paper mentioning the importance of side-chains for charge-mobility! \cite{May2011}
Next time read about tie-chains \cite{May2011} and/or charge mobility \cite{Lukyanov2010}
Lukyanov--sounds a lot like morphct, gaussian density of states? I thought their (votca's) method was like morphct but now I'm not sure... It seems like they're using a simplification and not doing dft.

\cite{Vehoff2010a}
rubrene record charge carrier $15 \frac{cm^{2}}{V s}$ single crystal by vapor deposition. typical for thin-film is $1 \frac{cm^{2}}{V s}$
good discussion of some of the assumption of marcus theory. 
Drude model (electrons bounce off stationary nuclei like a pinball machine) works for perfect crystals at low temp.
At RT it doesn't work. Marcus theory assumes nuclear dynamics much slower (Borne-Oppenheimer) and electronic coupling is weak (what does this mean exactly?). Static disorder is based on the electronic DOS and the hopping rate between localized states. (As opposed to what?)
They start with single crystal structures from xray data. They calculate reorganization energies with b3lyp 6-311G(d,p) and transfer integrals with ZINDO. (check their SI)
How are they able to calculate direction-resolved transfer integrals?? very cool. What exactly do the transfer integral graphs mean? (Figure 2) Had a helpful chat with Chris about this and it helped me to think through the figures. The y-axis on the transfer integral is counts and the x-axis is energies--it makes sense that movement of an electron in different directions would require different energies and/or be more likely. Still not sure how to calculate it though. 

Today I'm digging around in more of the votca stuff to try and figure out how to run kmc there. They use ORCA too! Also their tutorials and documentation REALLY SUCK. [https://github.com/votca/xtp-tutorials](https://github.com/votca/xtp-tutorials) in particular I'm looking at LAMMPS/KMC\_Thiophene.
OK. either I am dumb or that tutorial sucks. I can tell that they're using orca and the inputs/oputputs the use but there's no explanation of what they're doing. It looks like they calculate the reorganization energy, but they don't define a chromophore--which makes sense for thiophene but what about when your molecule is ginormous?
\cite{Ruhle2011b} discusses charge transport in amorphous films of [tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminium). Oh Figure 1 is nice--it is a workflow of what can be done in votca.
11A talks about how to parameterize new contributions to a force-field using first-principles.
11B choosing a "chromophore"-- rigid fragments vs conjugated segments. they broke apart the chromophore in a polymer like p3ht using the dihedral angle--although they validated this choice with other methods. Interesting-- they replace the chromophores with those which have been geometry optimized using DFT. then they make a neighbor list
I'll come back to this paper later. I at least was able to answer some of my questions about choosing a chromophore.
11C talks about calculating the transfer integral for each pair and why ZINDO works and when it breaks down.
