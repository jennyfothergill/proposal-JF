abstract = {Designing new high performances materials based on conducting polymers necessitates the development of multiscale models to investigate the charge transport in large realistic systems. In this work, we utilize Coarse-Grained (CG) Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to generate morphologies of Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) doped with Tosylate (TOS) ions, and we develop a backmapping protocol to retrieve the atomistic details of the molecules afterwards. We demonstrate that the proposed protocol corrects for the nanostructure distortions induced by Coarse-Graining the system, namely a wrong density and an over-estimated $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking distance. Quantum chemical calculations are performed on the systems obtained after backmapping in order to calculate hopping rates for charge transport, and charge mobilities as a function of the PEDOT chain length and hydration level are then calculated by solving a master equation for transport. The results are identical to the calculations performed on PEDOT morphologies obtained by direct All-Atomistic (AA) MD simulations: the mobility increases with the chain length and decreases with the hydration level, this last effect being more pronounced for short chains. This definitely shows that the workflow CG MD → backmapping → mobility calculations is in position to calculate charge mobility in PEDOT based materials, paving the way for theoretical investigations of transport in more complex materials such as PEDOT doped with Polystyrene Sulfonate (PSS).},

abstract = {We present an improved and extended version of our coarse grained lipid model. The new version, coined the MARTINI force field, is parametrized in a systematic way, based on the reproduction of partitioning free energies between polar and apolar phases of a large number of chemical compounds. To reproduce the free energies of these chemical building blocks, the number of possible interaction levels of the coarse-grained sites has increased compared to those of the previous model. Application of the new model to lipid bilayers shows an improved behavior in terms of the stress profile across the bilayer and the tendency to form pores. An extension of the force field now also allows the simulation of planar (ring) compounds, including sterols. Application to a bilayer/cholesterol system at various concentrations shows the typical cholesterol condensation effect similar to that observed in all atom representations.},

abstract = {Background: SMILES and SMARTS are two well-defined structure matching languages that have gained wide use in cheminformatics. Jmol is a widely used open-source molecular visualization and analysis tool written in Java and implemented in both Java and JavaScript. Over the past 10 years, from 2007 to 2016, work on Jmol has included the development of dialects of SMILES and SMARTS that incorporate novel aspects that allow new and powerful applications. Results: The specifications of "Jmol SMILES" and "Jmol SMARTS" are described. The dialects most closely resemble OpenSMILES and OpenSMARTS. Jmol SMILES is a superset of OpenSMILES, allowing a freer format, including whitespace and comments, the addition of "processing directives" that modify the meaning of certain aspects of SMILES processing such as aromaticity and stereochemistry, a more extensive treatment of stereochemistry, and several minor additions. Jmol SMARTS similarly adds these same modifications to OpenSMARTS, but also adds a number of additional "primitives" and elements of syntax tuned to matching 3D molecular structures and selecting their atoms. The result is an expansion of the capabilities of SMILES and SMARTS primarily for use in 3D molecular analysis, allowing a broader range of matching involving any combination of 3D molecular structures, SMILES strings, and SMARTS patterns. While developed specifically for Jmol, these dialects of SMILES and SMARTS are independent of the Jmol application itself. Conclusions: Jmol SMILES and Jmol SMARTS add value to standard SMILES and SMARTS. Together they have proven exceptionally capable in extracting valuable information from 3D structural models, as demonstrated in Jmol. Capabilities in Jmol enabled by Jmol SMILES and Jmol SMARTS include efficient MMFF94 atom typing, conformational identification, SMILES comparisons without canonicalization, identification of stereochemical relationships, quantitative comparison of 3D structures from different sources (including differences in Kekulization), conformational flexible fitting, and atom mapping used to synchronize interactive displays of 2D structures, 3D structures, and spectral correlations, where data are being drawn from multiple sources.},

abstract = {The conversion of coarse-grained to atomistic models is an important step in obtaining insight about atomistic scale processes from coarse-grained simulations. For this process, called backmapping or reverse transformation, several tools are available, but these commonly require libraries of molecule fragments or they are linked to a specific software package. In addition, the methods are usually restricted to specific molecules and to a specific force field. Here, we present an alternative method, consisting of geometric projection and subsequent force-field based relaxation. This method is designed to be simple and flexible, and offers a generic solution for resolution transformation. For simple systems, the conversion only requires a list of particle correspondences on the two levels of resolution. For special cases, such as nondefault protonation states of amino acids and virtual sites, a target particle list can be specified. The mapping uses simple building blocks, which list the particles on the different levels of resolution. For conversion to higher resolution, the initial model is relaxed with several short cycles of energy minimization and position-restrained MD. The reconstruction of an atomistic backbone from a coarse-grained model is done using a new dedicated algorithm. The method is generic and can be used to map between any two particle based representations, provided that a mapping can be written. The focus of this work is on the coarse-grained MARTINI force field, for which mapping definitions are written to allow conversion to and from the higher-resolution force fields GROMOS, CHARMM, and AMBER, and to and from a simplified three-bead lipid model. Together, these offer the possibility to simulate mesoscopic membrane structures, to be transformed to MARTINI and subsequently to an atomistic model for investigation of detailed interactions. The method was tested on a set of systems ranging from a simple, single-component bilayer to a large protein-membrane-solvent complex. The results demonstrate the efficiency and the efficacy of the new approach. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

We propose a method for extrapolating a macroscopic nondispersive mobility from the temperature dependence of a microscopic one. The method is tested on an amorphous phase of tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum, for which the temperature dependence of a microscopic hole mobility is obtained by combining molecular-dynamics simulations for generating material morphologies, electronic-structure calculations for determining charge hopping rates, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for studying charge dynamics.

Morphologies are generated using an all-atom force field, while charge dynamics is simulated within the framework of high-temperature nonadiabatic Marcus theory or using semiclassical dynamics. We conclude that, on the length scales reachable by molecular dynamics simulations, the charge transport in bulk molecular crystals is mostly limited by the dynamic disorder, while in self-assembled monolayers the static disorder, which is due to the slow motion of the side chains, enhances charge localization and influences the transport dynamics. We find that the presence of disorder can either reduce or increase charge carrier mobility, depending on the dimensionality of the charge percolation network. The advantages of charge transporting materials with two- or three-dimensional networks are clearly shown.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained models can be of great help to address the problem of structure prediction in nucleic acids. On one hand they can make the prediction more efficient, while on the other hand they can also help to identify the essential degrees of freedom and interactions for the description of a number of structures. With the aim to provide an all-atom representation in an explicit solvent to the predictions of our SPlit and conQueR (SPQR) coarse-grained model of RNA, we recently introduced a backmapping procedure which enforces the predicted structure into an atomistic one by means of steered molecular dynamics. These simulations minimize the ERMSD, a particular metric which deals exclusively with the relative arrangement of nucleobases, between the atomistic representation and the target structure. In this paper, we explore the effects of this approach on the resulting interaction networks and backbone conformations by applying it on a set of fragments using as a target their native structure. We find that the geometry of the target structures can be reliably recovered, with limitations in the regions with unpaired bases such as bulges. In addition, we observe that the folding pathway can also change depending on the parameters used in the definition of the ERMSD and the use of other metrics such as the RMSD.},

abstract = {Background: The Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) is an open source Java library for manipulating and processing chemical information. A key aspect in handling chemical structures is the determination of the chemical rings. The rings of a structure are used areas including descriptors, stereochemistry, similarity, screening and atom typing. The CDK includes multiple algorithms for determining the rings of a structure on demand. Non-unique descriptions of rings were often used due to the slower performance of the unique alternatives. Results: Efficient algorithms for handling chemical ring perception have been implemented and optimised in the CDK. The algorithms provide much faster computation of new and existing types of rings. Several optimisation and implementation considerations are discussed which improve real case usage. The performance is measured on several publicly available data sets and in several cases the new implementations were found to be more than an order of magnitude faster. Conclusions: Algorithmic improvements allow handling of much larger datasets in reasonable time. Faster computation allows more appropriate rings to be utilised in procedures such as aromaticity. Several areas that require ring perception have also seen a noticeable improvement. The time taken to compute the unique rings is now comparable allowing a correct usage throughout the toolkit.

A CG simulation decreases the degrees of freedom by mapping atoms from an FG representation into agglomerate CG particles. The FG to CG mapping is not unique. Research into systematic selection of these mappings is challenging due to their combinatorial growth with respect to the number of atoms in a molecule. Here we present a method of reducing the total count of mappings by imposing molecular topology and symmetry constraints. The count reduction is illustrated by considering all mappings for nearly 50 000 molecules. The resulting number of mapping operators is still large, so we introduce a novel hierarchical graphical approach which encodes multiple CG mapping operators. The encoding method is demonstrated for methanol and a 14-mer peptide. With the test cases, we show how the encoding can be used for automated selection of reasonable CG mapping operators.},

abstract = {Control over the morphology of the active layer of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells is paramount to achieve high-efficiency devices. However, no method currently available can predict morphologies for a novel donor-acceptor blend. An approach which allows reaching relevant length scales, retaining chemical specificity, and mimicking experimental fabrication conditions, and which is suited for high-throughput schemes has been proven challenging to find. Here, we propose a method to generate atom-resolved morphologies of BHJs which conforms to these requirements. Coarse-grain (CG) molecular dynamics simulations are employed to simulate the large-scale morphological organization during solution-processing. The use of CG models which retain chemical specificity translates into a direct path to the rational design of donor and acceptor compounds which differ only slightly in chemical nature. Finally, the direct retrieval of fully atomistic detail is possible through backmapping, opening the way for improved quantum mechanical calculations addressing the charge separation mechanism. The method is illustrated for the poly(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) mixture, and found to predict morphologies in agreement with experimental data. The effect of drying rate, P3HT molecular weight, and thermal annealing are investigated extensively, resulting in trends mimicking experimental findings. The proposed methodology can help reduce the parameter space which has to be explored before obtaining optimal morphologies not only for BHJ solar cells but also for any other solution-processed soft matter device.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) simulations have allowed access to larger length scales and longer time scales in the study of the dynamic processes of large biomolecules than all-atom (AA) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Backmapping from CG models to AA structures has long been studied because it enables us to gain detailed structure insights from CG simulations. Many methods first construct an AA structure from the CG model by fragments, random placement, or geometrical rules and subsequently optimize the solution via energy minimization, simulated annealing or position-restrained simulations. However, such methods may only work well on residue-level CG models and cannot consider the deviations of CG models. In this work, we describe, to the best of our knowledge, a new backmapping method based on Bayesian inference and restrained MD simulations. Restraints with log harmonic energy terms are defined according to the target CG model using the Bayesian inference in which the CG deviations can be estimated. From an initial AA structure obtained from either high-resolution experiments or homology modeling, a MD simulation with the aforementioned restraints is performed to obtain a final AA structure that is a backmapping of the target CG model. The method was validated using multiresolution CG models of the soluble extracellular region of the human epidermal growth factor receptor and was further applied to construct AA structures from CG simulations of the nucleosome core particle. The results demonstrate that our method can generate accurate AA structures of different types of biomolecules from multiple CG models with either residue-level resolution or much lower resolution than one-site-per-residue.},

abstract = {Coarse-grain potentials allow one to extend molecular simulations to length and time scales beyond those accesssible to atomistic representations of the interacting system. Since the coarse-grain potentials remove a large number of interaction sites and, hence, a large number of degrees of freedom, it is generally assumed that coarse-grain potentials are not transferable to different systems or state points (temperature and pressure). Here we apply lessons learned from the parametrization of transferable atomistic potentials to develop a systematic procedure for the parametrization of transferable coarse-grain potentials. In particular, we apply an iterative Boltzmann optimization for the determination of the bonded interactions for coarse-grain beads belonging to the same molecule and separated by one or two coarse-grain bonds and parametrize the nonbonded interactions by fitting to the vapor-liquid coexistence curves computed for selected molecules represented by the TraPPE-UA (transferable potentials for phase equilibria-united atom) force field. This approach is tested here for linear alkanes where parameters for C(3)H(7) end segments and for C(3)H(6) middle segments of the TraPPE-CG (transferable potentials for phase equilibria-coarse grain) force field are determined and it is shown that these parameters yield quite accurate vapor-liquid equilibria for neat n-hexane to n-triacontane and for the binary mixture of n-hexane and n-hexatriacontane. In addition, the position of the first peak in various radial distribution functions and the coordination number for the first solvation shell are well reproduced by the TraPPE-CG force field, but the first peaks are too high and narrow.},

For the most part these are hand-written parsers and quite complicated and hard to read, modify, maintain, optimize or reuse. A traditional computer science approach would use a parsing system like lex/yacc but that has not made much inroad in computational chemistry. The tools have been difficult to use, especially for error reporting and recovery, and most of the developers have a chemistry background and don't know the language theory underlying this approach. Modern programming languages and parser systems have made many of the difficulties disappear. I have been working with people from OpenSMILES [3] and several of the existing open source toolkits (Open Babel [4], CDK [5] and RDKit [6]) develop valid, useful grammars for SMILES and SMARTS. I have also been evaluating how to implement those grammars using parsing systems like ANTLR [7], PLY [8] and ragel [9]. My plan is to fold that work back into the different projects so there is a broader and more consistent support for these two important notations. I expect also that resulting code will be faster, more maintainable, and more flexible for trying new ideas. By documenting the different parts I hope the knowledge of how to use parser frameworks is disseminated into the computational chemistry development community and helps to develop the next generation of chemistry toolkits and line notations like MQL[10]. This poster presents some of the preliminary results of that work including a SMILES grammar, implementations for ANTLR and PLY, and early performance analysis.},

abstract = {Charge carrier dynamics in an organic semiconductor can often be described in terms of charge hopping between localized states. The hopping rates depend on electronic coupling elements, reorganization energies, and driving forces, which vary as a function of position and orientation of the molecules. The exact evaluation of these contributions in a molecular assembly is computationally prohibitive. Various, often semiempirical, approximations are employed instead. In this work, we review some of these approaches and introduce a software toolkit which implements them. The purpose of the toolkit is to simplify the workflow for charge transport simulations, provide a uniform error control for the methods and a flexible platform for their development, and eventually allow in silico prescreening of organic semiconductors for specific applications. All implemented methods are illustrated by studying charge transport in amorphous films of tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum, a common organic semiconductor. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {We introduce a method to bring nearly atomistic resolution to coarse-grained models, and we apply the method to proteins. Using a small number of coarse-grained sites (about one per eight atoms) but assigning an independent three-dimensional orientation to each site, we preferentially integrate out stiff degrees of freedom (bond lengths and angles, as well as dihedral angles in rings) that are accurately approximated by their average values, while retaining soft degrees of freedom (unconstrained dihedral angles) mostly responsible for conformational variability. We demonstrate that our scheme retains nearly atomistic resolution by mapping all experimental protein configurations in the Protein Data Bank onto coarse-grained configurations and then analytically backmapping those configurations back to all-atom configurations. This roundtrip mapping throws away all information associated with the eliminated (stiff) degrees of freedom except for their average values, which we use to construct optimal backmapping functions. Despite the 4:1 reduction in the number of degrees of freedom, we find that heavy atoms move only 0.051 {\AA} on average during the roundtrip mapping, while hydrogens move 0.179 {\AA} on average, an unprecedented combination of efficiency and accuracy among coarse-grained protein models. We discuss the advantages of such a high-resolution model for parametrizing effective interactions and accurately calculating observables through direct or multiscale simulations.},
