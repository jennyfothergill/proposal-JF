abstract = {It is essential to be able to systematically construct coarse-grained (CG) models that can efficiently and accurately reproduce key properties of higher-resolution models such as all-atom. To fulfill this goal, a mapping operator is needed to transform the higher-resolution configuration to a CG configuration. Certain mapping operators, however, may lose information related to the underlying electrostatic properties. In this paper, a new mapping operator based on the centers of charge of CG sites is proposed to address this issue. Four example systems are chosen to demonstrate this concept. Within the multiscale coarse-graining framework, CG models that use this mapping operator are found to better reproduce the structural correlations of atomistic models. The present work also demonstrates the flexibility of the mapping operator and the robustness of the force matching method. For instance, important functional groups can be isolated and emphasized in the CG model.},

abstract = {Systems composed of soft matter (e.g., liquids, polymers, foams, gels, colloids, and most biological materials) are ubiquitous in science and engineering, but molecular simulations of such systems pose particular computational challenges, requiring time and/or ensemble-averaged data to be collected over long simulation trajectories for property evaluation. Performing a molecular simulation of a soft matter system involves multiple steps, which have traditionally been performed by researchers in a "bespoke" fashion, resulting in many published soft matter simulations not being reproducible based on the information provided in the publications. To address the issue of reproducibility and to provide tools for computational screening, we have been developing the open-source Molecular Simulation and Design Framework (MoSDeF) software suite. In this paper, we propose a set of principles to create Transparent, Reproducible, Usable by others, and Extensible (TRUE) molecular simulations. MoSDeF facilitates the publication and dissemination of TRUE simulations by automating many of the critical steps in molecular simulation, thus enhancing their reproducibility. We provide several examples of TRUE molecular simulations: All of the steps involved in creating, running and extracting properties from the simulations are distributed on open-source platforms (within MoSDeF and on GitHub), thus meeting the definition of TRUE simulations.},

abstract = {We have evaluated the performance of a set of widely used force fields by calculating the geometries and stabilization energies for a large collection of intermolecular complexes. These complexes are representative of a range of chemical and biological systems for which hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and van der Waals interactions play important roles. Benchmark energies are taken from the high-level ab initio values in the JSCH-2005 and S22 data sets. All of the force fields underestimate stabilization resulting from hydrogen bonding, but the energetics of electrostatic and van der Waals interactions are described more accurately. OPLSAA gave a mean unsigned error of 2 kcal mol−1 for all 165 complexes studied, and outperforms DFT calculations employing very large basis sets for the S22 complexes. The magnitude of hydrogen bonding interactions are severely underestimated by all of the force fields tested, which contributes significantly to the overall mean error; if complexes which are predominantly bound by hydrogen bonding interactions are discounted, the mean unsigned error of OPLSAA is reduced to 1 kcal mol−1. For added clarity, web-based interactive displays of the results have been developed which allow comparisons of force field and ab initio geometries to be performed and the structures viewed and rotated in three dimensions.},

abstract = {The photovoltaic effect involves the production of electrons and holes in a semiconductor device under illumination, and their subsequent collection at opposite electrodes. In many inorganic semiconductors, photon absorption produces free electrons and holes directly1. But in molecular semiconductors, absorption creates electron-hole pairs (excitons) which are bound at room temperature2, so that charge collection requires their dissociation. Exciton dissociation is known to be efficient at interfaces between materials with different electron affinities and ionization potentials, where the electron is accepted by the material with larger electron affinity and the hole by the material with lower ionization potential3. A two-layer diode structure can thus be used, in which excitons generated in either layer diffuse towards the interface between the layers. However, the exciton diffusion range is typically at least a factor of 10 smaller than the optical absorption depth, thus limiting the efficiency of charge collection3. Here we show that the interpenetrating network formed from a phase-segregated mixture of two semiconducting polymers provides both the spatially distributed interfaces necessary for efficient charge photo-generation, and the means for separately collecting the electrons and holes. Devices using thin films of these polymer mixtures show promise for large-area photodetectors. {\textcopyright} 1995, Nature Publishing Group. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract = {Evaluating new, promising organic molecules to make next-generation organic optoelectronic devices necessitates the evaluation of charge carrier transport performance through the semi-conducting medium. In this work, we utilize quantum chemical calculations (QCC) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations to predict the zero-field hole mobilities of ∼100 morphologies of the benchmark polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene), with varying simulation volume, structural order, and chain-length polydispersity. Morphologies with monodisperse chains were generated previously using an optimized molecular dynamics force-field and represent a spectrum of nanostructured order. We discover that a combined consideration of backbone clustering and system-wide disorder arising from side-chain conformations are correlated with hole mobility. Furthermore, we show that strongly interconnected thiophene backbones are required for efficient charge transport. This definitively shows the role “tie-chains” play in enabling mobile charges in P3HT. By marrying QCC and KMC over multiple length- and time-scales, we demonstrate that it is now possible to routinely probe the relationship between molecular nanostructure and device performance.},

abstract = {Coarse-grain potentials allow one to extend molecular simulations to length and time scales beyond those accesssible to atomistic representations of the interacting system. Since the coarse-grain potentials remove a large number of interaction sites and, hence, a large number of degrees of freedom, it is generally assumed that coarse-grain potentials are not transferable to different systems or state points (temperature and pressure). Here we apply lessons learned from the parametrization of transferable atomistic potentials to develop a systematic procedure for the parametrization of transferable coarse-grain potentials. In particular, we apply an iterative Boltzmann optimization for the determination of the bonded interactions for coarse-grain beads belonging to the same molecule and separated by one or two coarse-grain bonds and parametrize the nonbonded interactions by fitting to the vapor-liquid coexistence curves computed for selected molecules represented by the TraPPE-UA (transferable potentials for phase equilibria-united atom) force field. This approach is tested here for linear alkanes where parameters for C(3)H(7) end segments and for C(3)H(6) middle segments of the TraPPE-CG (transferable potentials for phase equilibria-coarse grain) force field are determined and it is shown that these parameters yield quite accurate vapor-liquid equilibria for neat n-hexane to n-triacontane and for the binary mixture of n-hexane and n-hexatriacontane. In addition, the position of the first peak in various radial distribution functions and the coordination number for the first solvation shell are well reproduced by the TraPPE-CG force field, but the first peaks are too high and narrow.},

As an extensive test case we coarse-grained an atomistic all-atom model of polyisoprene (PI) using a 13:1 reduction of the degrees of freedom. This procedure was performed for PI solutions as well as for a PI melt. Comparisons of the obtained force fields are drawn.

The features of the donor-acceptor morphology (e.g., domain shapes, crystalline/amorphous domains, and donor-acceptor interface) can in principle be tuned by choosing the chemistry and architecture of the conjugated polymer, fullerene functional group, solvents, and processing conditions (e.g., annealing temperature). Here, we present a high-throughput coarse-grained simulation study that links molecular-level design parameters to features in the assembled morphology in neat polymers and donor-acceptor blends. These models reproduce neat polymer morphologies observed in experiments, such as lamellae, hexagonally packed cylinders, and acceptor intercalation among donor side chains.

In this work, we demonstrate an automated approach by viewing this problem as supervised learning where we seek to reproduce the mapping operators produced by experts. We present a graph neural network based CG mapping predictor called DEEP SUPERVISED GRAPH PARTITIONING MODEL(DSGPM) that treats mapping operators as a graph segmentation problem. DSGPM is trained on a novel dataset, Human-annotated Mappings (HAM), consisting of 1,206 molecules with expert annotated mapping operators. HAM can be used to facilitate further research in this area. Our model uses a novel metric learning objective to produce high-quality atomic features that are used in spectral clustering.

A stable and phase-separated blend film with the fibrillar P3HT structure was observed after CG simulation of the thermal annealing process, and by the reverse-mapping technique the atomistic details - showing strong $\pi$-$\pi$ interaction between thiophene rings - were retrieved. To evaluate the morphologies of P3HT:PCBM blends, a spatial-discretization scheme was developed. With such a scheme, we estimated the average domain sizes, interface-to-volume ratios, and percolation ratios of the blends at different P3HT:PCBM weight ratios. The average domain sizes determined through these simulations were in excellent agreement with those reported experimentally. Moreover, our simulations indicated that blend films having weight ratios close to 1:1 would have the highest interface-to-volume ratio and the most balanced charge carrier transport in both the P3HT and PCBM phases, consistent with the experimental observation that a 1:1 weight ratio is optimal for P3HT:PCBM blends.

abstract = {Under certain conditions the conjugated polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) self-assembles into high-aspect-ratio nanostructures (known as nanofibres, nanowires, or nanoribbons) when cooled below its solubility limit in a marginal solvent such as anisole. Such nanostructures are potentially beneficial for organic photovoltaic device performance. In this work, Langevin dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained model of P3HT in implicit anisole solvent are used to study the self-assembly of P3HT nanostructures for polymer chain lengths and concentrations used experimentally to prepare P3HT nanofibres. The coarse-grained model is parametrised to match the local structure and dynamics of an atomistic model with explicit solvent. Nanofibres are also prepared experimentally and characterised by atomic force microscopy and UV-vis spectroscopy. The simulations match the experimental phase behaviour of P3HT in anisole, showing aggregation of P3HT at 293 and 308 K but not at 323 or 353 K. Single-chain simulations at 293 K reveal two distinct nano-scale aggregate morphologies: hairpins and helices. Hairpin aggregates, which are the precursors of nanofibres, are slightly favoured energetically at 293 K for nuclei of the critical size of ≈80 monomers for aggregation. Consequently, chains in multi-chain aggregates adopt the hairpin morphology exclusively in simulations at experimental concentrations at 293 K. The simulated aggregate sizes match experimentally measured nanofibre widths. An estimate of the shift in UV-vis absorption of P3HT due to the change in conjugation length with aggregation in the simulations agrees reasonably well with experiment and shows that most of the spectral red shift that occurs with nanofibre formation is due to increased planarisation of the P3HT chains. In addition to providing insight into the mechanisms of nanofibre formation, the simulations resolve details of the molecular-level organisation of chains in P3HT nanofibres hitherto inaccessible by experiment. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Several different techniques are similar in that they replace a model expressed in fully atomistic detail with a coarse-grained model of the same polymer, atomistic → coarse-grained (and beyond!), thereby increasing the time and distance scales accessible within the expenditure of reasonable computational resources. The bridge represented by the right-pointing arrow can be constructed via different procedures, which are reviewed here. The review also considers the status of methods which reverse this arrow, atomistic ← coarse-grained. This "reverse-mapping" recovers a model expressed in fully atomistic detail from an arbitrarily chosen replica generated during the simulation of the coarse-grained system.

abstract = {In this review, we focus on four current related issues in multiscale modeling of soft and biological matter. First, we discuss how to use structural information from detailed models (or experiments) to construct coarse-grained ones in a hierarchical and systematic way. This is discussed in the context of the so-called Henderson theorem and the inverse Monte Carlo method of Lyubartsev and Laaksonen. In the second part, we take a different look at coarse graining by analyzing conformations of molecules. This is done by the application of self-organizing maps, i.e., a neural network type approach. Such an approach can be used to guide the selection of the relevant degrees of freedom. Then, we discuss technical issues related to the popular dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method. Importantly, the potentials derived using the inverse Monte Carlo method can be used together with the DPD thermostat. In the final part we focus on solvent-free modeling which offers a different route to coarse graining by integrating out the degrees of freedom associated with solvent},

abstract = {Many physical phenomena and properties of soft matter systems such as synthetic or biological materials are governed by interactions and processes on a wide range of length- and time-scales. Computer simulation approaches that are targeted at questions in these systems require models which cover these scales and the respective levels of resolution. Multiscale simulation methods combine and systematically link several simulation hierarchies so that they can address phenomena at multiple levels of resolution. In order to reach the mesoscopic time- and length-scales important for many material properties, methods that bridge from the atomistic (microscopic) to a coarser (mesocopic) level are developed. Here, we review coarse-grained simulation models that are linked to a higher resolution atomistic description. In particular, we focus on structure-based coarse-graining methods which are used for a variety of soft matter problems - ranging from structure-formation in amorphous polymers to biomolecular aggregation. It is shown that by coarse-grained simulation in combination with an efficient backmapping methodology one can obtain well-equilibrated long time- and large length-scale atomistic structures of polymeric melts or biomolecular aggregates which can be used for comparison to experimental data. Methodological aspects are addressed such as the question of the time-scales and dynamics in the different simulation hierarchies and an outlook to future challenges in the area of resolution exchange approaches and adaptive resolution models is presented. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Today, solar power conversion efficiencies in excess of 3{\%} have been accomplished with several device concepts. Though efficiencies of these thin-film organic devices have not yet reached those of their inorganic counterparts ($\eta$ ≈ 10-20{\%}); the perspective of cheap production (employing, e.g., roll-to-roll processes) drives the development of organic photovoltaic devices further in a dynamic way. The two competitive production techniques used today are either wet solution processing or dry thermal evaporation of the organic constituents. The field of organic solar cells profited well from the development of light-emitting diodes based on similar technologies, which have entered the market recently.

The characterization of the nanomorphology is carried out via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), while solar-cell devices were characterized by means of current-voltage (I-V) and spectral photocurrent measurements. In addition, the morphology is manipulated via annealing, to increase the extent of phase separation in the thin-film blends and to identify the distribution of materials. Photoluminescence measurements confirm the demising of the materials under thermal treatment Furthermore the photoluminescence of PCBM clusters with sizes of up to a few hundred nanometers indicates a photocurrent loss in films of the coarser phase-separated blends cast from toluene. For toluene-cast films the scale of phase separation depends strongly on the ratio of MDMO-PPV to PCBM, as well as on the total concentration of the casting solution. Finally we observe small beads of 20-30 nm diameter, attributed to MDMO-PPV, in blend films cast from both toluene and chlorobenzene.},

The polymer chains are gradually disentangled in a marginal solvent via ultrasonication of the polymer solution, and demonstrate improved diffusivity of precursor species (coils, aggregates, and microcrystallites), enhanced nucleation and crystallization of P3HT in solution, and self-assembly of well-ordered and highly textured fibrils at the solid-liquid interface. In low-M-w P3HT, reducing chain entanglement enhances interchain and intrachain ordering, but reduces the interconnectivity of ordered domains (tie molecules) due to the presence of short chains, thus deteriorating carrier transport even in the face of improving crystallinity. Reducing chain entanglement in high-M-w P3HT solutions increases carrier mobility up to approximate to 20-fold, by enhancing interchain and intrachain ordering while maintaining a sufficiently large number of tie molecules between ordered domains. These results indicate that charge carrier mobility is strongly governed by the balancing of intrachain and interchain ordering, on the one hand, and interconnectivity of ordered domains, on the other hand. In high-M-w P3HT, intrachain and interchain ordering appear to be the key bottlenecks to charge transport, whereas in low-M-w P3HT, the limited interconnectivity of the ordered domains acts as the primary bottleneck to charge transport.},

abstract = {The self-organization of the polymer in solar cells based on regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (RR-P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is studied systematically as a function of the spin-coating time ts (varied from 20-80 s), which controls the solvent annealing time ta, the time taken by the solvent to dry after the spin-coating process. These blend films are characterized by photoluminescence spectroscopy, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements. The results indicate that the $\pi$-conjugated structure of RR-P3HT in the films is optimally developed when ta is greater than 1 min (ts-50 s). For ts {\textless} 50 s, both the short-circuit current (JSC) and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the corresponding polymer solar cells show a plateau region, whereas for 50 {\textless} ts {\textless} 55 s, the JSC and PCE values are significantly decreased, suggesting that there is a major change in the ordering of the polymer in this time window. The PCE decreases from 3.6{\%} for a film with a highly ordered $\pi$-conjugated structure of RR-P3HT to 1.2 {\%} for a less-ordered film. GIXRD results confirm the change in the ordering of the polymer. In particular, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency spectrum of the less-ordered solar cell shows a clear loss in both the overall magnitude and the long-wavelength response. The solvent annealing effect is also studied for devices with different concentrations of PCBM (PCBM concentrations ranging from 25 to 67 wt {\%}). Under "solvent annealing" conditions, the polymer is seen to be ordered even at 67 wt {\%} PCBM loading. The open-circuit voltage (VOC) is also affected by the ordering of the polymer and the PCBM loading in the active layer. {\textcopyright} 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA,.},

abstract = {Control over the morphology of the active layer of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells is paramount to achieve high-efficiency devices. However, no method currently available can predict morphologies for a novel donor-acceptor blend. An approach which allows reaching relevant length scales, retaining chemical specificity, and mimicking experimental fabrication conditions, and which is suited for high-throughput schemes has been proven challenging to find. Here, we propose a method to generate atom-resolved morphologies of BHJs which conforms to these requirements. Coarse-grain (CG) molecular dynamics simulations are employed to simulate the large-scale morphological organization during solution-processing. The use of CG models which retain chemical specificity translates into a direct path to the rational design of donor and acceptor compounds which differ only slightly in chemical nature. Finally, the direct retrieval of fully atomistic detail is possible through backmapping, opening the way for improved quantum mechanical calculations addressing the charge separation mechanism. The method is illustrated for the poly(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) mixture, and found to predict morphologies in agreement with experimental data. The effect of drying rate, P3HT molecular weight, and thermal annealing are investigated extensively, resulting in trends mimicking experimental findings. The proposed methodology can help reduce the parameter space which has to be explored before obtaining optimal morphologies not only for BHJ solar cells but also for any other solution-processed soft matter device.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained modeling is a key component in the field of multiscale simulation. Many biomolecular and otherwise complex systems require the characterization of phenomena over multiple length and time scales in order to fully resolve and understand their behavior. These different scales range from atomic to near macroscopic dimensions, and they are generally not independent of one another, but instead coupled. That is, phenomena occurring at atomic length scales have an effect at macroscopic dimensions and vice versa. Systematic transfer of information between these different scales represents a core challenge in the field of multiscale simulation. Coarse-grained modeling works at an intermediate resolution that can bridge the very high resolution (atomic) scale to the very low resolution (macroscopic) scale. As such, a significant challenge Is the development of a systematic methodology whereby coarse-grained models can be derived from their high-resolution atomistic-scale counterpart. Here, a systematic theoretical and computational methodology will be described for developing coarse-grained representations of biomolecular and other soft-matter systems. At the heart of the methodology is a variational statistical mechanical algorithm that uses force-matching of atomistic molecular dynamics data to a coarse-grained representation. A theoretical analysis of the coarse-graining methodology will be presented, along with illustrative applications to membranes, peptides, and carbohydrates.},

abstract = {We introduce a method to bring nearly atomistic resolution to coarse-grained models, and we apply the method to proteins. Using a small number of coarse-grained sites (about one per eight atoms) but assigning an independent three-dimensional orientation to each site, we preferentially integrate out stiff degrees of freedom (bond lengths and angles, as well as dihedral angles in rings) that are accurately approximated by their average values, while retaining soft degrees of freedom (unconstrained dihedral angles) mostly responsible for conformational variability. We demonstrate that our scheme retains nearly atomistic resolution by mapping all experimental protein configurations in the Protein Data Bank onto coarse-grained configurations and then analytically backmapping those configurations back to all-atom configurations. This roundtrip mapping throws away all information associated with the eliminated (stiff) degrees of freedom except for their average values, which we use to construct optimal backmapping functions. Despite the 4:1 reduction in the number of degrees of freedom, we find that heavy atoms move only 0.051 {\AA} on average during the roundtrip mapping, while hydrogens move 0.179 {\AA} on average, an unprecedented combination of efficiency and accuracy among coarse-grained protein models. We discuss the advantages of such a high-resolution model for parametrizing effective interactions and accurately calculating observables through direct or multiscale simulations.},

Morphologies are generated using an all-atom force field, while charge dynamics is simulated within the framework of high-temperature nonadiabatic Marcus theory or using semiclassical dynamics. We conclude that, on the length scales reachable by molecular dynamics simulations, the charge transport in bulk molecular crystals is mostly limited by the dynamic disorder, while in self-assembled monolayers the static disorder, which is due to the slow motion of the side chains, enhances charge localization and influences the transport dynamics. We find that the presence of disorder can either reduce or increase charge carrier mobility, depending on the dimensionality of the charge percolation network. The advantages of charge transporting materials with two- or three-dimensional networks are clearly shown.},

abstract = {Designing new high performances materials based on conducting polymers necessitates the development of multiscale models to investigate the charge transport in large realistic systems. In this work, we utilize Coarse-Grained (CG) Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to generate morphologies of Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) doped with Tosylate (TOS) ions, and we develop a backmapping protocol to retrieve the atomistic details of the molecules afterwards. We demonstrate that the proposed protocol corrects for the nanostructure distortions induced by Coarse-Graining the system, namely a wrong density and an over-estimated $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking distance. Quantum chemical calculations are performed on the systems obtained after backmapping in order to calculate hopping rates for charge transport, and charge mobilities as a function of the PEDOT chain length and hydration level are then calculated by solving a master equation for transport. The results are identical to the calculations performed on PEDOT morphologies obtained by direct All-Atomistic (AA) MD simulations: the mobility increases with the chain length and decreases with the hydration level, this last effect being more pronounced for short chains. This definitely shows that the workflow CG MD → backmapping → mobility calculations is in position to calculate charge mobility in PEDOT based materials, paving the way for theoretical investigations of transport in more complex materials such as PEDOT doped with Polystyrene Sulfonate (PSS).},

After photo-excitation of the conjugated polymer with light of energy greater than the $\pi$-$\pi$* gap, an electron transfer to the C60 molecule is initiated. Photoinduced optical absorption studies demonstrate a different excitation spectrum for the composite as compared to the separate components, consistent with photo-excited charge transfer. A photoinduced electron spin resonance signal exhibits signatures of both the conducting polymer cation and the C60 anion. Because the photoluminescence in the conducting polymer is quenched by interaction with C60, the data imply that charge transfer from the excited state occurs on a picosecond time scale.

abstract = {Coarse-grained models can be of great help to address the problem of structure prediction in nucleic acids. On one hand they can make the prediction more efficient, while on the other hand they can also help to identify the essential degrees of freedom and interactions for the description of a number of structures. With the aim to provide an all-atom representation in an explicit solvent to the predictions of our SPlit and conQueR (SPQR) coarse-grained model of RNA, we recently introduced a backmapping procedure which enforces the predicted structure into an atomistic one by means of steered molecular dynamics. These simulations minimize the ERMSD, a particular metric which deals exclusively with the relative arrangement of nucleobases, between the atomistic representation and the target structure. In this paper, we explore the effects of this approach on the resulting interaction networks and backbone conformations by applying it on a set of fragments using as a target their native structure. We find that the geometry of the target structures can be reliably recovered, with limitations in the regions with unpaired bases such as bulges. In addition, we observe that the folding pathway can also change depending on the parameters used in the definition of the ERMSD and the use of other metrics such as the RMSD.},

abstract = {The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450-600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the "dust bowl" era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4 -1.0 m if 21st century CO2 concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6 -1.9 m for peak CO2 concentrations exceeding ≈1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) simulations have allowed access to larger length scales and longer time scales in the study of the dynamic processes of large biomolecules than all-atom (AA) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Backmapping from CG models to AA structures has long been studied because it enables us to gain detailed structure insights from CG simulations. Many methods first construct an AA structure from the CG model by fragments, random placement, or geometrical rules and subsequently optimize the solution via energy minimization, simulated annealing or position-restrained simulations. However, such methods may only work well on residue-level CG models and cannot consider the deviations of CG models. In this work, we describe, to the best of our knowledge, a new backmapping method based on Bayesian inference and restrained MD simulations. Restraints with log harmonic energy terms are defined according to the target CG model using the Bayesian inference in which the CG deviations can be estimated. From an initial AA structure obtained from either high-resolution experiments or homology modeling, a MD simulation with the aforementioned restraints is performed to obtain a final AA structure that is a backmapping of the target CG model. The method was validated using multiresolution CG models of the soluble extracellular region of the human epidermal growth factor receptor and was further applied to construct AA structures from CG simulations of the nucleosome core particle. The results demonstrate that our method can generate accurate AA structures of different types of biomolecules from multiple CG models with either residue-level resolution or much lower resolution than one-site-per-residue.},

abstract = {New electron-acceptor materials are long sought to overcome the small photovoltage, high-cost, poor photochemical stability, and other limitations of fullerene-based organic photovoltaics. However, all known nonfullerene acceptors have so far shown inferior photovoltaic properties compared to fullerene benchmark [6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM), and there are as yet no established design principles for realizing improved materials. Herein we report a design strategy that has produced a novel multichromophoric, large size, nonplanar three-dimensional (3D) organic molecule, DBFI-T, whose $\pi$-conjugated framework occupies space comparable to an aggregate of 9 [C60]-fullerene molecules. Comparative studies of DBFI-T with its planar monomeric analogue (BFI-P2) and PC60BM in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, by using a common thiazolothiazole-dithienosilole copolymer donor (PSEHTT), showed that DBFI-T has superior charge photogeneration and photovoltaic properties; PSEHTT:DBFI-T solar cells combined a high short-circuit current (10.14 mA/cm2) with a high open-circuit voltage (0.86 V) to give a power conversion efficiency of 5.0{\%}. The external quantum efficiency spectrum of PSEHTT:DBFI-T devices had peaks of 60-65{\%} in the 380-620 nm range, demonstrating that both hole transfer from photoexcited DBFI-T to PSEHTT and electron transfer from photoexcited PSEHTT to DBFI-T contribute substantially to charge photogeneration. The superior charge photogeneration and electron-accepting properties of DBFI-T were further confirmed by independent Xenon-flash time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements, which correctly predict the relative magnitudes of the conversion efficiencies of the BHJ solar cells: PSEHTT:DBFI-T {\textgreater} PSEHTT:PC60BM {\textgreater} PSEHTT:BFI-P2. The results demonstrate that the large size, multichromophoric, nonplanar 3D molecular design is a promising approach to more efficient organic photovoltaic materials.},

abstract = {Background: The Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) is an open source Java library for manipulating and processing chemical information. A key aspect in handling chemical structures is the determination of the chemical rings. The rings of a structure are used areas including descriptors, stereochemistry, similarity, screening and atom typing. The CDK includes multiple algorithms for determining the rings of a structure on demand. Non-unique descriptions of rings were often used due to the slower performance of the unique alternatives. Results: Efficient algorithms for handling chemical ring perception have been implemented and optimised in the CDK. The algorithms provide much faster computation of new and existing types of rings. Several optimisation and implementation considerations are discussed which improve real case usage. The performance is measured on several publicly available data sets and in several cases the new implementations were found to be more than an order of magnitude faster. Conclusions: Algorithmic improvements allow handling of much larger datasets in reasonable time. Faster computation allows more appropriate rings to be utilised in procedures such as aromaticity. Several areas that require ring perception have also seen a noticeable improvement. The time taken to compute the unique rings is now comparable allowing a correct usage throughout the toolkit.

abstract = {We have developed a new-generation Amber united-atom force field for simulations involving highly demanding conformational sampling such as protein folding and protein-protein binding. In the new united-atom force field, all hydrogens on aliphatic carbons in all amino acids are united with carbons except those on C alpha. Our choice of explicit representation of all protein backbone atoms aims at minimizing perturbation to protein backbone conformational distributions and to simplify development of backbone torsion terms. Tests with dipeptides and solvated proteins show that our goal is achieved quite successfully. The new united-atom force field uses the same new RESP charging scheme based on B3LYP/cc-pVTZ//HF/6-31g** quantum mechanical calculations in the PCM continuum solvent as that in the Duan et al. force field. van der Waals parameters are empirically refitted starting from published values with respect to experimental solvation free energies of amino acid side-chain analogues. The suitability of mixing new point charges and van der Waals parameters with existing Amber covalent terms is tested on alanine dipeptide and is found to be reasonable. Parameters for all new torsion terms are refitted based on the new point charges and the van der Waals parameters. Molecular dynamics simulations of three small globular proteins in the explicit TIP3P solvent are performed to test the overall stability and accuracy of the new united-atom force field. Good agreements between the united-atom force field and the Duan et al. all-atom force field for both backbone and side-chain conformations are observed. In addition, the per-step efficiency of the new united-atom force field is demonstrated for simulations in the implicit generalized Born solvent. A speedup around two is observed over the Duan et al. all-atom force field for the three tested small proteins. Finally, the efficiency gain of the new united-atom force field in conformational sampling is further demonstrated with a well-known toy protein folding system, an 18 residue polyalanine in distance-dependent dielectric. The new united-atom force field is at least a factor of 200 more efficient than the Duan et al. all-atom force field for ab initio folding of the tested peptide.},

To better understand the mechanics of the skin, a molecular-level understanding of the structure of the lamellae needs to be investigated. As a first step toward this goal, the current work involves the development of a coarse-grained model for fatty acids in an amorphous and a crystalline state. In order to retain the structural details of the atomistic molecules, radial distribution functions have been used to provide target data against which the coarse-grained force field is optimized. The optimization was achieved using the method developed by Reith, P{\"{u}}tz, and M{\"{u}}ller-Plathe with a damping factor introduced into the updating scheme to facilitate the convergence against the crystalline radial distribution functions. Using this approach, a transferable force field has been developed for both crystalline and amorphous systems that can be used to describe fatty acids of different chain lengths. We are unaware of any other coarse-grained model in the literature that has been developed to study solid phases. Additionally, the amorphous force field has been shown to accurately model mixtures of different free fatty acids based on the potentials derived from pure lipid systems. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

For the most part these are hand-written parsers and quite complicated and hard to read, modify, maintain, optimize or reuse. A traditional computer science approach would use a parsing system like lex/yacc but that has not made much inroad in computational chemistry. The tools have been difficult to use, especially for error reporting and recovery, and most of the developers have a chemistry background and don't know the language theory underlying this approach. Modern programming languages and parser systems have made many of the difficulties disappear. I have been working with people from OpenSMILES [3] and several of the existing open source toolkits (Open Babel [4], CDK [5] and RDKit [6]) develop valid, useful grammars for SMILES and SMARTS. I have also been evaluating how to implement those grammars using parsing systems like ANTLR [7], PLY [8] and ragel [9]. My plan is to fold that work back into the different projects so there is a broader and more consistent support for these two important notations. I expect also that resulting code will be faster, more maintainable, and more flexible for trying new ideas. By documenting the different parts I hope the knowledge of how to use parser frameworks is disseminated into the computational chemistry development community and helps to develop the next generation of chemistry toolkits and line notations like MQL[10]. This poster presents some of the preliminary results of that work including a SMILES grammar, implementations for ANTLR and PLY, and early performance analysis.},

The hopping rates depend on electronic coupling elements, reorganization energies, and driving forces, which vary as a function of position and orientation of the molecules. The exact evaluation of these contributions in a molecular assembly is computationally prohibitive. Various, often semiempirical, approximations are employed instead. In this work, we review some of these approaches and introduce a software toolkit which implements them. The purpose of the toolkit is to simplify the workflow for charge transport simulations, provide a uniform error control for the methods and a flexible platform for their development, and eventually allow in silico prescreening of organic semiconductors for specific applications.

abstract = {The conversion of coarse-grained to atomistic models is an important step in obtaining insight about atomistic scale processes from coarse-grained simulations. For this process, called backmapping or reverse transformation, several tools are available, but these commonly require libraries of molecule fragments or they are linked to a specific software package. In addition, the methods are usually restricted to specific molecules and to a specific force field. Here, we present an alternative method, consisting of geometric projection and subsequent force-field based relaxation. This method is designed to be simple and flexible, and offers a generic solution for resolution transformation. For simple systems, the conversion only requires a list of particle correspondences on the two levels of resolution. For special cases, such as nondefault protonation states of amino acids and virtual sites, a target particle list can be specified. The mapping uses simple building blocks, which list the particles on the different levels of resolution. For conversion to higher resolution, the initial model is relaxed with several short cycles of energy minimization and position-restrained MD. The reconstruction of an atomistic backbone from a coarse-grained model is done using a new dedicated algorithm. The method is generic and can be used to map between any two particle based representations, provided that a mapping can be written. The focus of this work is on the coarse-grained MARTINI force field, for which mapping definitions are written to allow conversion to and from the higher-resolution force fields GROMOS, CHARMM, and AMBER, and to and from a simplified three-bead lipid model. Together, these offer the possibility to simulate mesoscopic membrane structures, to be transformed to MARTINI and subsequently to an atomistic model for investigation of detailed interactions. The method was tested on a set of systems ranging from a simple, single-component bilayer to a large protein-membrane-solvent complex. The results demonstrate the efficiency and the efficacy of the new approach. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

We propose a method for extrapolating a macroscopic nondispersive mobility from the temperature dependence of a microscopic one. The method is tested on an amorphous phase of tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum, for which the temperature dependence of a microscopic hole mobility is obtained by combining molecular-dynamics simulations for generating material morphologies, electronic-structure calculations for determining charge hopping rates, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for studying charge dynamics. The extracted value of the nondispersive mobility and its electric field dependence agree well with the results of time-of-flight experiments. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

The significant progress is the result of multidisciplinary research ranging from chemistry, material science, physics, and engineering. These efforts include the design and synthesis of novel compounds, understanding and controlling the film morphology, elucidating the device mechanisms, developing new device architectures, and improving large-scale manufacture. All of these achievements catalyzed the rapid growth of the OPV technology. This review article takes a retrospective look at the research and development of OPV, and focuses on recent advances of solution-processed materials and devices during the last decade, particular the polymer version of the materials and devices. The work in this field is exciting and OPV technology is a promising candidate for future thin film solar cells.},

abstract = {Recently, the non-fullerene acceptor ITIC has attracted a lot of attention in terms of its prominent performance in organic solar cell (OSC). A better match with the donor materials is critical for it, so we on one hand compared the match of two typical donors PBDB-T and PBQ-0F with ITIC trying to find the main difference between them. On the other hand, we designed two donors 1 and 2 based on the same 2D-BDT unit and estimated their cell efficiency aiming to explore more effective donors for ITIC. The molecular dynamics simulation was carried out to get more practical photovoltaic interface, and the density functional theory was employed to estimate the cell efficiency. It is found that PBDB-T not only exhibits higher charge separation efficiency depending on larger charge separation and smaller charge recombination rates than PBQ-0F, but also displays stronger electron-hole coherence from donor to acceptor fragments at its S1 state than PBQ-0F indicating its easier exciton dissociation at excited states. The stronger electron-withdrawing ability of the acceptor fragment in PBDB-T is concluded to make the main contribution to its higher charge separation efficiency, which is further proved by our designed donors 1 and 2. Molecule 2 with stronger electron-withdrawing ability of the acceptor fragment than PBDB-T shows better charge separation performance at the interface than PBDB-T, which again suggests introducing strong electron-withdrawing group in this kind of donors may be a good choice for improving the performance of organic solar cell using ITIC as acceptor.},

abstract = {Achieving efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs) requires a structurally optimal donor-acceptor heterojunction morphology. Here we report the combined experimental and theoretical characterization of a benzodithiophene-benzothiadiazole donor polymer series (PBTZF4-R; R = alkyl substituent) blended with the non-fullerene acceptor ITIC-Th and analyze the effects of substituent dimensions on blend morphology, charge transport, carrier dynamics, and PSC metrics. Varying substituent dimensions has a pronounced effect on the blend morphology with a direct link between domain purity, to some extent domain dimensions, and charge generation and collection. The polymer with the smallest alkyl substituent yields the highest PSC power conversion efficiency (PCE, 11{\%}), reflecting relatively small, high-purity domains and possibly benefiting from "matched" donor polymer-small molecule acceptor orientations. The distinctive morphologies arising from the substituents are investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations which reveal that substituent dimensions dictate a well-defined set of polymer conformations, in turn driving chain aggregation and, ultimately, the various film morphologies and mixing with acceptor small molecules. A straightforward energetic parameter explains the experimental polymer domain morphological trends, hence PCE, and suggests strategies for substituent selection to optimize PSC materials morphologies.},

abstract = {A fused-ring thiophene-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-thiophene (4T)-based low-band gap electron acceptor, 4TIC, has been designed and synthesized for non-fullerene solar cells. The utilization of the 4T center core enhances the charge mobility of 4TIC and extends its absorption band edge to 900 nm, which facilitates its function as a very efficient low-band gap electron acceptor. The rigid, conjugated framework of 4T also offers a lower reorganization energy to facilitate lower VOC energy loss. Femtosecond transient spectroscopy showed a level of polaron generation in 4TIC results in the more efficient transfer of energetic carriers higher than that seen with the benchmarked molecule, ITIC. Film morphology analysis has also shown that 4TIC has structural order that is more prominent than that of ITIC with a multiscale phase separation in the blend with donor polymer PTB7-Th. As a result, solar cells based on PTB7-Th and 4TIC exhibit a high power conversion efficiency of 10.43{\%} and a relatively low non-ideal photon energy loss of 0.33 V. The low band gap and small energy loss make 4TIC suitable for tandem solar cells as a back-cell to reduce the transmission loss. As a demonstration, we fabricated series connection tandem solar cells incorporating 4TIC, which exhibts a high device performance of 12.62{\%}.},

abstract = {The blossoming of organic solar cells (OSCs) has triggered enormous commercial applications, due to their high-efficiency, light weight, and flexibility. However, the lab-to-manufacturing translation of the praisable performance from lab-scale devices to industrial-scale modules is still the Achilles' heel of OSCs. In fact, it is urgent to explore the mechanism of morphological evolution in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) with different coating/printing methods. Here, a general approach to upscale flexible organic photovoltaics to module scale without obvious efficiency loss is demonstrated. The shear impulse during the coating/printing process is first applied to control the morphology evolution of the BHJ layer for both fullerene and nonfullerene acceptor systems. A quantitative transformation factor of shear impulse between slot-die printing and spin-coating is detected. Compelling results of morphological evolution, molecular stacking, and coarse-grained molecular simulation verify the validity of the impulse translation. Accordingly, the efficiency of flexible devices via slot-die printing achieves 9.10{\%} for PTB7-Th:PC71BM and 9.77{\%} for PBDB-T:ITIC based on 1.04 cm2. Furthermore, 15 cm2 flexible modules with effective efficiency up to 7.58{\%} (PTB7-Th:PC71BM) and 8.90{\%} (PBDB-T:ITIC) are demonstrated with satisfying mechanical flexibility and operating stability. More importantly, this work outlines the shear impulse translation for organic printing electronics.},

Here we demonstrate highly efficient and stable solar cells using a ternary approach, wherein two non-fullerene acceptors are combined with both a scalable and affordable donor polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and a high-efficiency, low-bandgap polymer in a single-layer bulk-heterojunction device. The addition of a strongly absorbing small molecule acceptor into a P3HT-based non-fullerene blend increases the device efficiency up to 7.7 ± 0.1{\%} without any solvent additives. The improvement is assigned to changes in microstructure that reduce charge recombination and increase the photovoltage, and to improved light harvesting across the visible region. The stability of P3HT-based devices in ambient conditions is also significantly improved relative to polymer:fullerene devices. Combined with a low-bandgap donor polymer (PBDTTT-EFT, also known as PCE10), the two mixed acceptors also lead to solar cells with 11.0 ± 0.4{\%} efficiency and a high open-circuit voltage of 1.03 ± 0.01 V.},

The first paper (Levitt {\&} Warshel, 1975) outlined the approach and showed how it could be used to simulate the "renaturation" of a small protein. The present paper describes the representation in some detail and tests the methods extensively under a variety of different conditions. The third paper (Warshel {\&} Levitt, 1976) is devoted to a study of the folding pathway and stability of a mainly $\alpha$-helical protein. In this work, I show how the concept of time-averaged forces, introduced previously (Levitt {\&} Warshel, 1975), can be used to simplify conformational energy calculations on globular proteins. A detailed description is given of the simplified molecular geometry, the parameterization of suitable force fields, the best energy minimization procedure, and the techniques for escaping from local minima. Extensive tests of the method on the native conformation of pancreatic trypsin inhibitor show that the simplifications work well in representing the stable native conformation of this globular protein. Further tests show that simulated folding of pancreatic trypsin inhibitor from open chain conformations gives compact calculated conformations that have many features in common with the actual native conformation. Folding simulations are done under a variety of conditions, and the relevance of such calculations to the actual in vitro folding process is discussed at some length. These same techniques have many potential applications including enzyme-substrate binding, changes in protein tertiary and quaternary structure, and protein-protein interactions. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

@article{Hanson2016,
abstract = {Background: SMILES and SMARTS are two well-defined structure matching languages that have gained wide use in cheminformatics. Jmol is a widely used open-source molecular visualization and analysis tool written in Java and implemented in both Java and JavaScript. Over the past 10 years, from 2007 to 2016, work on Jmol has included the development of dialects of SMILES and SMARTS that incorporate novel aspects that allow new and powerful applications. Results: The specifications of "Jmol SMILES" and "Jmol SMARTS" are described. The dialects most closely resemble OpenSMILES and OpenSMARTS. Jmol SMILES is a superset of OpenSMILES, allowing a freer format, including whitespace and comments, the addition of "processing directives" that modify the meaning of certain aspects of SMILES processing such as aromaticity and stereochemistry, a more extensive treatment of stereochemistry, and several minor additions. Jmol SMARTS similarly adds these same modifications to OpenSMARTS, but also adds a number of additional "primitives" and elements of syntax tuned to matching 3D molecular structures and selecting their atoms. The result is an expansion of the capabilities of SMILES and SMARTS primarily for use in 3D molecular analysis, allowing a broader range of matching involving any combination of 3D molecular structures, SMILES strings, and SMARTS patterns. While developed specifically for Jmol, these dialects of SMILES and SMARTS are independent of the Jmol application itself. Conclusions: Jmol SMILES and Jmol SMARTS add value to standard SMILES and SMARTS. Together they have proven exceptionally capable in extracting valuable information from 3D structural models, as demonstrated in Jmol. Capabilities in Jmol enabled by Jmol SMILES and Jmol SMARTS include efficient MMFF94 atom typing, conformational identification, SMILES comparisons without canonicalization, identification of stereochemical relationships, quantitative comparison of 3D structures from different sources (including differences in Kekulization), conformational flexible fitting, and atom mapping used to synchronize interactive displays of 2D structures, 3D structures, and spectral correlations, where data are being drawn from multiple sources.},

This model differs from previous models in that the Lennard-Jones well depth for the terminal methyl group 0.2264 kcal/mol differs from that of the methylene units 0.093 kcal/mol. The position of the minimum is at 4.5 {\AA} for both units. Properties of n-C44H90 melts from this model are compared with experiments and those from an explicit atom model. Good agreement with experiment is obtained for static properties of the melt, specifically P–V–T behavior, chain conformations, and x-ray scattering profiles. The large-scale dynamics, as measured by self-diffusion, are found to agree reasonably well with experimental results, being about 30{\%} faster with our best united atom force field. Analysis of the end-to-end vector orientation autocorrelation function in terms of the Rouse model yields a monomer friction coefficient somewhat greater than that determined from the rate of self-diffusion, reflecting the fact that the n-C44H90 chains are not sufficiently long to behave as Gaussian coils. Detailed local chain dynamics for n-C44H90 melts, as measured by the P1(t) and P2(t) orientation autocorrelation functions for C–H vectors, are found to agree reasonably well with results from simulations using an explicit atom model, and yield spin-lattice relaxation times T1 and nuclear Overhauser enhancement values in reasonable agreement with experimental 13C NMR measurements.

abstract = {We develop coarse-grained (CG) computer simulation models of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and P3HT/fullerene-C60 mixtures, in which collections of atoms from a physically accurate atomistic model are mapped onto a smaller number of "superatoms". These CG models allow much larger systems to be simulated for longer durations than is achievable atomistically, making it possible to study in molecular detail the morphology of polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunctions at length and time scales relevant to organic photovoltaic devices. We demonstrate that our CG models, parametrized at two state points, accurately capture the structure of atomistic systems at other points in the mixture phase diagram. Finally, we use our CG models to study the dynamic evolution of the microstructure of a P3HT/C60 bulk heterojunction in a system approaching the device scale.

abstract = {The nanoscale morphology within the photoactive layer of organic solar cells is critical in determining the power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, we draw attention to the roles of molecular arrangement, and domain size in improving performance, which can be tuned by subjecting the photovoltaic materials to solvent vapor annealing (SVA). In our PTB7-Th:ITIC devices, the PCE can be improved by exposing the device to solvent vapor for 60 s after solution casting. The solvent vapor prolongs reorganizational time and increases molecular ordering and domain size/phase separation, which are sub-optimal in pristine PTB7-Th:ITIC blend films. This improved morphology results in better charge mobility, reduced recombination, and ultimately an improved PCE from 7.1{\%} to 7.9{\%} when using CS2 as the annealing solvent. This simple SVA technique can be applied to a range of OPV systems where the molecular ordering is inferior within the as-cast photoactive layer.},

abstract = {Despite the rapid development of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), the fundamental understanding on the relationship between NFA molecular architecture, morphology, and device performance is still lacking. Herein, poly[[4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b0]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]-thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7-Th) is used as the donor polymer to compare an NFA with a 3D architecture (SF-PDI4) to a well-studied NFA with a linear acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) architecture (ITIC). The data suggest that the NFA ITIC with a linear molecular structure shows a better device performance due to an increase in short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) compared to the 3D SF-PDI4. The charge generation dynamics measured by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) reveals that the exciton dissociation process in the PTB7-Th:ITIC films is highly efficient. In addition, the PTB7-Th:ITIC blend shows a higher electron mobility and lower energetic disorder compared to the PTB7-Th:SF-PDI4 blend, leading to higher values of Jsc and FF. The compositional sensitive resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) results indicate that ITIC molecules form more pure domains with reduced domain spacing, resulting in more efficient charge transport compared with the SF-PDI4 blend. It is proposed that both the molecular structure and the corresponding morphology of ITIC play a vital role for the good solar cell device performance.},

IDTT acceptors typically pack in a face-to-face fashion with $\pi$–$\pi$ distances ranging from 3.28–3.95 {\AA}. Additionally, edge-to-face packing is observed with S⋯$\pi$ interactions as short as 3.21–3.24 {\AA}. Moreover, ITIC end group identities and side chain substituents influence the nature and strength of noncovalent interactions (e. g. H-bonding, $\pi$–$\pi$) and thus correlate with the observed packing motif, electronic structure, and charge transport properties of the crystals. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal relatively large nearest-neighbor intermolecular $\pi$-$\pi$ electronic couplings (5.85–56.8 meV) and correlate the nature of the band structure with the dispersion interactions in the single crystals and core–end group polarization effects. Overall, this combined experimental and theoretical work reveals key insights into crystal engineering strategies for indacenodithienothiophene (IDTT) acceptors, as well as general design rules for high-efficiency post-fullerene small molecule acceptors.},

A surprisingly low degree of order was found in the polymer-far lower in the bulk heterojunction than in pure PTB7. X-ray diffraction data yielded a nearly full orientation distribution for the polymer $\pi$-stacking direction within well-ordered regions, revealing a moderate preference for $\pi$-stacking in the vertical direction ("face-on"). By combining molecular orientation information from polarizing absorption spectroscopies with the orientation distribution of ordered material from diffraction, we propose a model describing the PTB7 molecular orientation distribution (ordered and disordered), with the fraction of ordered polymer as a model parameter. This model shows that only a small fraction (≈20{\%}) of the polymer in the PTB7/PC71BM blend is ordered. Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy shows that the morphology of PTB7/PC 71BM is composed of nanoscale fullerene-rich aggregates separated by polymer-rich regions. The addition of diiodooctane (DIO) to the casting solvent, as a processing additive, results in smaller domains and a more finely interpenetrating BHJ morphology, relative to blend films cast without DIO. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) models of biomolecules have recently attracted considerable interest because they enable the simulation of complex biological systems on length-scales and timescales that are inaccessible for atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. ACG model is defined by a map that transforms an atomically detailed configuration into a CG configuration. For CG models of relatively small biomolecules or in cases that the CG and all-atom models have similar resolution, the construction of this map is relatively straightforward and can be guided by chemical intuition. However, it is more challenging to construct a CG map when large and complex domains of biomolecules have to be represented by relatively few CG sites. This work introduces a new and systematic methodology called essential dynamics coarse-graining (ED-CG). This approach constructs a CG map of the primary sequence at a chosen resolution for an arbitrarily complex biomolecule. In particular, the resulting ED-CG method variationally determines the CG sites that reflect the essential dynamics characterized by principal component analysis of an atomistic molecular dynamics trajectory. Numerical calculations illustrate this approach for the HIV-1 CA protein dimer and ATP-bound G-actin. Importantly, since the CG sites are constructed from the primary sequence of the biomolecule, the resulting ED-CG model may be better suited to appropriately explore protein conformational space than those from other CG methods at the same degree of resolution. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Low-cost photovoltaic energy conversion using conjugated molecular materials has become increasingly feasible through the development of organic 'bulk heterojunction (BHJ)' structures, where efficient light-induced charge separation is enabled by a large-area donor-acceptor interface. The highest efficiencies have been achieved using blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and a fullerene derivative, but performance depends critically on the material properties and processing conditions. This variability is believed to be influenced by the self-organizing properties of P3HT, which means that both optical and electronic properties are sensitive to the molecular packing. However, the relationship between molecular nanostructure, optoelectronic properties of the blend material and device performance has not yet been demonstrated. Here we focus on the influence of polymer regioregularity (RR) on the molecular nanostructure, and hence on the resulting material properties and device performance. We find a strong influence of RR on solar-cell performance, which can be attributed to enhanced optical absorption and transport resulting from the organization of P3HT chains and domains. Further optimization of devices using the highest RR material resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 4,4{\%}, even without optimization of electrode.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) can simulate systems inaccessible to fine-grained (FG) MD simulations. A CG simulation decreases the degrees of freedom by mapping atoms from an FG representation into agglomerate CG particles. The FG to CG mapping is not unique. Research into systematic selection of these mappings is challenging due to their combinatorial growth with respect to the number of atoms in a molecule. Here we present a method of reducing the total count of mappings by imposing molecular topology and symmetry constraints. The count reduction is illustrated by considering all mappings for nearly 50 000 molecules. The resulting number of mapping operators is still large, so we introduce a novel hierarchical graphical approach which encodes multiple CG mapping operators. The encoding method is demonstrated for methanol and a 14-mer peptide. With the test cases, we show how the encoding can be used for automated selection of reasonable CG mapping operators.},

It is shown that the inclusion of target data from multiple states yields a less state-dependent potential, and is thus better suited to simulate systems over a range of thermodynamic states than the standard IBI method. The inclusion of target data from multiple states forces the algorithm to sample regions of potential phase space that match the radial distribution function at multiple state points, thus producing a derived potential that is more representative of the underlying interactions. It is shown that the algorithm is able to converge to the true potential for a system where the underlying potential is known. It is also shown that potentials derived via the proposed method better predict the behavior of n-alkane chains than those derived via the standard IBI method. Additionally, through the examination of alkane monolayers, it is shown that the relative weight given to each state in the fitting procedure can impact bulk system properties, allowing the potentials to be further tuned in order to match the properties of reference atomistic and/or experimental systems.},

To reproduce the free energies of these chemical building blocks, the number of possible interaction levels of the coarse-grained sites has increased compared to those of the previous model. Application of the new model to lipid bilayers shows an improved behavior in terms of the stress profile across the bilayer and the tendency to form pores.
