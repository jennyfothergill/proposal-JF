abstract = {We analyze the relationship among the molecular structure, morphology, percolation network, and charge carrier mobility in four organic crystals: rubrene, indolo[2,3-b]carbazole with CH3 side chains, and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-bâ€²]bis[b]benzothiophene derivatives with and without C4H9 side chains. Morphologies are generated using an all-atom force field, while charge dynamics is simulated within the framework of high-temperature nonadiabatic Marcus theory or using semiclassical dynamics. We conclude that, on the length scales reachable by molecular dynamics simulations, the charge transport in bulk molecular crystals is mostly limited by the dynamic disorder, while in self-assembled monolayers the static disorder, which is due to the slow motion of the side chains, enhances charge localization and influences the transport dynamics. We find that the presence of disorder can either reduce or increase charge carrier mobility, depending on the dimensionality of the charge percolation network. The advantages of charge transporting materials with two- or three-dimensional networks are clearly shown.},

abstract = {Discotic mesophases are known for their ability to self-assemble into columnar structures which serve as semiconducting molecular wires. Charge-carrier mobility along these wires strongly depends on molecular packing which is controlled by intermolecular interactions. Using solid-state NMR and molecular dynamics simulations we relate how conformations of alkyl and glycol side chains affect helical pitch and angular distribution of molecules within the columnar structures of perylenediimide derivatives. Using the high-temperature limit of Marcus theory we then establish a link between the secondary structure and charge-carrier mobility. Simulation results are compared to pulse-radiolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements. We conclude that for achieving high charge-carrier mobilities in discotics, side chains with specific interactions are required in order to minimize the translational and orientational molecular disorder in the columns. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

@article{Marrink2007,
abstract = {We present an improved and extended version of our coarse grained lipid model. The new version, coined the MARTINI force field, is parametrized in a systematic way, based on the reproduction of partitioning free energies between polar and apolar phases of a large number of chemical compounds. To reproduce the free energies of these chemical building blocks, the number of possible interaction levels of the coarse-grained sites has increased compared to those of the previous model. Application of the new model to lipid bilayers shows an improved behavior in terms of the stress profile across the bilayer and the tendency to form pores. An extension of the force field now also allows the simulation of planar (ring) compounds, including sterols. Application to a bilayer/cholesterol system at various concentrations shows the typical cholesterol condensation effect similar to that observed in all atom representations.},

@article{Chakraborty2018a,
abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) can simulate systems inaccessible to fine-grained (FG) MD simulations. A CG simulation decreases the degrees of freedom by mapping atoms from an FG representation into agglomerate CG particles. The FG to CG mapping is not unique. Research into systematic selection of these mappings is challenging due to their combinatorial growth with respect to the number of atoms in a molecule. Here we present a method of reducing the total count of mappings by imposing molecular topology and symmetry constraints. The count reduction is illustrated by considering all mappings for nearly 50 000 molecules. The resulting number of mapping operators is still large, so we introduce a novel hierarchical graphical approach which encodes multiple CG mapping operators. The encoding method is demonstrated for methanol and a 14-mer peptide. With the test cases, we show how the encoding can be used for automated selection of reasonable CG mapping operators.},

@article{Maerzke2011,
abstract = {Coarse-grain potentials allow one to extend molecular simulations to length and time scales beyond those accesssible to atomistic representations of the interacting system. Since the coarse-grain potentials remove a large number of interaction sites and, hence, a large number of degrees of freedom, it is generally assumed that coarse-grain potentials are not transferable to different systems or state points (temperature and pressure). Here we apply lessons learned from the parametrization of transferable atomistic potentials to develop a systematic procedure for the parametrization of transferable coarse-grain potentials. In particular, we apply an iterative Boltzmann optimization for the determination of the bonded interactions for coarse-grain beads belonging to the same molecule and separated by one or two coarse-grain bonds and parametrize the nonbonded interactions by fitting to the vapor-liquid coexistence curves computed for selected molecules represented by the TraPPE-UA (transferable potentials for phase equilibria-united atom) force field. This approach is tested here for linear alkanes where parameters for C(3)H(7) end segments and for C(3)H(6) middle segments of the TraPPE-CG (transferable potentials for phase equilibria-coarse grain) force field are determined and it is shown that these parameters yield quite accurate vapor-liquid equilibria for neat n-hexane to n-triacontane and for the binary mixture of n-hexane and n-hexatriacontane. In addition, the position of the first peak in various radial distribution functions and the coordination number for the first solvation shell are well reproduced by the TraPPE-CG force field, but the first peaks are too high and narrow.},

@article{Lukyanov2010,
abstract = {Predictions of charge-carrier mobilities in amorphous semiconductors often rely on charge transport simulations in microscopically sized systems, where transport is dispersive and mobilities are system-size dependent. We propose a method for extrapolating a macroscopic nondispersive mobility from the temperature dependence of a microscopic one. The method is tested on an amorphous phase of tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum, for which the temperature dependence of a microscopic hole mobility is obtained by combining molecular-dynamics simulations for generating material morphologies, electronic-structure calculations for determining charge hopping rates, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for studying charge dynamics. The extracted value of the nondispersive mobility and its electric field dependence agree well with the results of time-of-flight experiments. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},
