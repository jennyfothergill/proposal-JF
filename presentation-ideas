problem statement - climate change, energy statistics
more problem - explain nrel graph (maybe show original graph, and say wow lot of PV tech, then switch to simplified graph--tell the story of the simplified graph)
set up why we care about OPVS 
talk about the history of opvs
talk about how an opv works
and why they are a zoo show figure with LOTS of opvs combinatoric EXPLOSION of possibilities
maybe go through the scientist example -- explain why it is hard for a wet lab to test ALL these combinations
then segue to simulation why is simulation a good thing here? what are the struggles of simulating this system? length/time scales, electronic properties
talk about the plan -- coarse graining, backmapping, charge transport
coarse graining
    - what it is
    - mapping operator
    - msibi
backmapping
    - why it is necessary
    - how it would work
charge transport
    - brief
Somewhere in here talk about best practices/why doing something that has already been done _better_ is still worth doing.
why computational sciences are hard
why do i care about this?
plan specifics
timeline
