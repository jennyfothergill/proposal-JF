background:
opvs why they matter
why morphology matters to BHJ devices
the limits of simulation and why we need coarse-graining
what coarse-graining techniques exist
we needed backmapping to look at electrical properties
what backmapping exists
what CT calculations have been done
what I want to add:
- automate coarse graining /backmapping with SMILES
- this will help us address the zoo
Preliminary results:
- CG_tutorial
- backmapping from Mike and Matty
Plan of how I will do it?????
- not really sure what should go in this section, maybe how I plan to leverage open source tools/version control/ unit testing and in general good software dev practices. 
- keep simulations relevant to experiment by comparing diffraction?
